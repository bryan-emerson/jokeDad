# Dad Jokes 2.0 is here!

This is a new and imporved iteration of the previous Dad Jokes app you already love!

## Technology Used

This is a single page React app using functional component based architecture. Hooks and Props are used for state management. The useEffect hook makes an intial fetch call to the Dad Jokes API. These initial jokes are rendered until the user enters a search term in the form. The form input is used to programatically update the fetch call on change, and new jokes matching the search term are rendered!
